# Optimisation_of_Deflate_Algorithm
The optimized Deflate algorithm demonstrates a significant enhancement over the traditional
Deflate approach through the implementation of adaptive window management. By
dynamically adjusting the sliding window size based on data repetitiveness, the algorithm
achieves improved compression efficiency, lower processing times, and reduced memory
overhead.
These advancements lead to better storage utilization and faster data transmission, making
the optimized algorithm particularly beneficial in scenarios where bandwidth is limited or
storage costs are a concern. The potential for further research includes exploring extensions
of the adaptive mechanism and integration with existing compression tools, which could
enhance its applicability in various domains.
